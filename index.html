        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Allcare Express Health is a new initiative introduced by Allcare that aims to revolutionize the way customers interact with their pharmacy. The initiative is focused on enhancing convenience, speed, and satisfaction for customers, and it is achieved through the use of our new cutting-edge Mobile App that enables customers to place Express Orders and pay remotely through a secure SMS payment link.  <br><br>

Allcare's goal is to create an exceptional customer experience that sets them apart from the competition and strengthens customer loyalty. To achieve this goal, Allcare has implemented a new workflow that allows customers to conveniently order items, pay, collect, and go, and they have provided guidelines for stores to follow to ensure the success of the Allcare Express Health Initiative.<br><br>

Allcare Express Health is not merely an app or payment method, but rather a comprehensive experience that encompasses a streamlined in-store medication acquisition process, designed to enhance the brand's overall image, reputation, and customer experience. By providing an integrated journey that exceeds the individual components, Allcare aspires to create a seamless experience for its customers. Currently in a pilot phase at six locations, we aim to learn, adapt, and ultimately expand this successful program to all of our stores.<br><br>


Initial Goals of Trial:  Measure the uptake of Express Health Experience by Patients.  Measure Patient Feedback, Store Experience and Iterate Enhancements for full store rollout.  <br><br></p>


<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Uniform Rnd'; color: #eb008b; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Post trial, parts of this process will be automated with phase 2 upgrades and integrations based on feedback from participating stores.

There is a tick box for you to mark the item paid on the sticker when you receive payment.  This way you can know even between shifts what bags are still awaiting payment vs those that are paid.
